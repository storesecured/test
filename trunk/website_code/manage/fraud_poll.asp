                  Detailed information on Fraud tool
                  <BR>
                  This is a short overview of steps that you can take as a merchant to reduce credit card fraud. 
It is most applicable to e-commerce sites delivering goods digitally, however these steps can 
also be applied to other types of credit card sales over the Internet. 

<p>
There are two general approaches available. You can use software programs to automatically detect 
and screen through all of your transactions or you can manually check each transaction for possible fraud. 
Neither approach is perfect when used by itself. The automatic approach can sometimes flag or impede 
legitimate sales. While performing the manual checks for all transactions is ideal, there is a trade-off 
in merchant time and hassle, long-distance bills, and customer inconvenience.  

<p>

CCFD enables you to combine both 
automatic and manual checks. This service allows you to screen transactions automatically 
so that you can pay attention only to the transactions that are flagged as potentially fraudulent 
by the system. With this service, your business will save money and time, increase productivity, 

and maintain a high security guard against fraud.

<p><span class=kickerBlue><a name="iploc"></a>IP Address Location</span>
<br>
A potential risk of fraud can result from a discrepancy between a person's claimed location 
and the location of the computer he is making the transaction from.  Fraud services can 
authenticate the transaction by matching up the billing address of the card holder with their 
actual physical location, determined by examining their IP address*.  Of course, the person
could simply be travelling or using a business card issued to a company branch in a different city or even country. 


<p><span class=kickerBlue><a name="email"></a>E-mail Domain</span>
<br>
Many fraudsters use a free e-mail provider such as hotmail.com to remain anonymous.  Of course
many legitimate clients use free e-mail as well. For business to
business transactions, we recommend checking out the domain by typing "http://www." and the
domain name into your browser and looking to see if the website looks like a legitimate business.
For consumer purchases, of course this doesn't apply.

<p><span class=kickerBlue><a name="proxies"></a>Anonymous and Open Proxies</span>
<br>
One of the ways fraudsters evade attempts to track them down is to use an Anonymous
or Open Proxy.  These proxies hide the true location of the client, like a ski mask would hide identity 
of a bank robber in the real world. We have noticed a high number (perhaps 40%) of our fraudulent
purchases come from Open Proxies, and it is known that organized credit card fraud
rings use Open Proxies.
<p>
On the other hand, legitimate orders do come from Open Proxies - usually these are orders where the user's computer has been
unknowingly infected by a virus that allows spammers and credit card hackers to hijack their computer.
In our experience about 4% of legitimate purchases come from Open Proxies, due to the widespread propagation of
computer viruses.  Our suggestion is to contact the customer to obtain more information.  You can refer them
to <a href="http://openrbl.org/">openrbl.org</a> if they would like verification that their IP address is
listed on Open Proxy lists.
<p>
In addition to reporting Anonymous and Open Proxies, our CCFD Service returns
whether the IP address belongs to a reported spam source.  We have received a couple of fraudulent
orders from IP Addresses labeled as spam sources, and we block these because it is likely that spammers
participate in credit card fraud.
<p><span class=kickerBlue><a name="bin"></a>Bank Identification Number Check</span>
<br>
Many international credit cards don't support address verification.  Checking the Bank Identification
Number (BIN) provides a way to see if the issuing bank for the credit card is in the same country
as where the card holder is resident.  Note that
legitimate users sometimes do use a credit card from another country.  
<p>
You can also ask the customer to provide the bank name and customer
service phone number as listed on the credit card.  This information
can then be verified against the Fraud database to see if it matches
the information we have on record for the BIN.  This provides an
additional layer of protection by verifying that the user has physical
possession of the credit card unless a fraudster found
this information by accessing a compromised BIN name and phone number
list.
