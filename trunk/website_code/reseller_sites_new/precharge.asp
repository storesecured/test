<font color="#FF4200" size="3"><b>NEW - Easystorecreator now comes 
        preCharge Certified Payments Enabled</b></font><p><font size="2">Did you 
        know that chargebacks can dramatically impact your business, causing the 
        need for a reserve account, increased fees or even the loss of your 
        merchant account?</font></p>
        <p>Easystorecreator<font size="2"> comes enabled with the preCharge 
        Certified Payments suite with every plan. The preCharge service ensures 
        the highest level of protection for merchants and is 100% guaranteed. In 
        the event that your company receives a chargeback or fraudulent charge 
        while using preCharge, the approved transaction will be covered 100% by 
        preCharge including up to $35.00 in bank fees.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><b>Independent Fraud Protection</b><br>
        The relationship between a client and a merchant is too valuable to 
        leave to anyone else. We recognize that your clients are, in fact, your 
        clients. The preCharge system DOES NOT interact with the client in any 
        way. It is completely transparent to the client and at no time will 
        third parties attempt to contact the client. No user registration and no 
        user confirmation.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><b>Security<br>
        </b>Always keep your information confidential. Transactions are 
        processed and submitted via SSL 3.0 strong encryption. All data is 
        encrypted using a&nbsp; 256bit encryption scheme and is only accessible 
        via a secure, password-protected merchant area. At no time is ANY data 
        communicated or used for outside purposes.</font></p>
