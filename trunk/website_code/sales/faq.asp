With any service except BASIC you can have as many email accounts as needed.  By default
all stores are given 1 catch-all email address where anything@yourdomain.com will be forwarded.

multiple email contacts.<BR><BR>

required to use the easystorecreator domain name.<BR><BR>
<B>I sell software, music or ebooks, can they be downloaded automatically?</B><BR>
Yes, if you sell files they can be downloaded automatically if you are using a real-time
processor and your shoppers pay by either credit card or echeck.  Once the order is verified the
shopper will be shown a download link.<BR><BR>
<B>Can I buy your software to put on my servers?</B><BR>

information.  Shoppers will notice no difference except that their browser is now secured.<BR><BR>
<B>I already have a website, can your software be integrated with it?</B><BR>
Yes, our software is provided as a service, which can either be used to create an entire store or to 
create add to cart buttons to place on another site.  What we have done for many of clients is to create a store that looks exactly like their website
then create links between the 2 and the user will not notice that they leave one site and go to another.
Or, if you current site is only a store you can move the entire site over to our server.<BR><BR>

for stores requiring large amounts of space.<BR><BR>

Yes, we work with a variety of processors both in the US and internationally.  We are currently offering
a special rate of $0 application fee, $25 monthly fee, 25¢ transaction fee, and 2.25% discount rate.
