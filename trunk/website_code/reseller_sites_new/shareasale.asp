	<b>Access to millions of visitors</b><br>
	Performance Marketing is one of the most powerful and effective customer 
	aquisition tools available to an online merchant. You decide the commission 
	structure to pay - and only pay when results come in. With a program managed 
	by Shareasale.com, you enable the network of highly motivated sales experts to 
	promote your products to all of their visitors - through websites, email newsletters, 
	and loyal customer bases. You can choose to setup your progarm to pay on a 
	percentage of a sale (pay-per-sale), a pay-per-lead basis (PPL or CPA), or a pay-per-click.

	<b>What is Share-A-Sale</b><br>
	Shareasale began on the premise that they could provide any merchant - large or small - with 
	high quality, reliable tracking software - at a lower cost than the industry norm - with the added 
	benefit of being plugged into a large network of quality affiliate sites. They believe in, and depend 
	on - the strong relationship between a motivated salesperson (the Affiliate), and a Merchant. They 
	have a reputation in the industry for being fair, honest, and proactive to customer concerns.
