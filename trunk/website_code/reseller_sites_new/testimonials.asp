<B>Here are some of the good things our customers have said ...</b><BR><BR>
For more than a year...
we have been looking for the perfect shopping cart
system. We actually paid for xxxx  but
had many problems with it - quite complex to set up.
<BR>
A Yahoo store was attractive, but expensive and not
easy for Canadian companies.
<BR>
I think <%= Name %> is the best so far.
Best of ease of use, power and affordable.

I just wanted to tell you that your company by far has the best 
customer service I have dealt with yet!!. I was with xxxx
for a year for my store but there customer service was so slow at 
answering e-mails, sometimes it took 2 days to answer my questions 
and I was limited to what I could do with my stores templates. You 
have always helped me out quickly and pleasantly, and for that I 
thank you. With my lack of knowledge with HTML and website building, 
you would think you would hate to answer all my questions, but you 
always get back to me so fast and you never seem like you are agitated. 
Thank you for your patience and for your quick answers to all my 
questions. God Bless!!<BR>

I did want to comment, I have used or tried much more expensive store
builders than yours, but few of them are as feature rich. Thank you for
offering such a reasonable commerce solution.<BR>

<%= Name %> takes cutting edge E-Store technologies and makes it easy
to understand, implement, and customize.  But that's not even their best
feature.  The Support Staff is unbelievable!  They are fast, detailed
experts who are 110% responsive.  It's comforting to know that as my company
grows, ESC will still be the best partner for years to come.
 Thanks!<BR>
