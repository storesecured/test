		<h1>eCommerce Merchant Account Setup and eCommerce Web Site Software...<br>
		  Is Ecommerce Right for Your Small Business?</h1>
		<p>Getting a solid handle on what's actually a quivering mass of Jell-o 
		  requires attention to a pair of practical issues about e-commerce: what 
		  it really is and who it's for. Only after considering these basics can 
		  you determine what your specific e-commerce strategy could or couldn't 
		  be, or should or shouldn't be. What follows is my attempt to break down 
		  the issues into five statements that I hope will guide your thinking. 
		  <BR>
		  <BR>
		  1. In your business, e-commerce is a concept that is aligned with, if 
		  not directly related to, your presence on the Internet. <BR>
		  When the Internet was "new," which I define as the time it was opened 
		  to the general public as opposed to the academic or scientific world (before 
		  Al Gore invented it, right?), everyone "had to have the Internet" to be 
		  competitive, and heck, to keep their doors opened. A lot of flutter swirled 
		  around getting on the Internet and not nearly enough around what that 
		  meant. <BR>
		  During this new era, I counseled many a worried business owner about what 
		  to do. At that time, the Internet was thought to be a marketing tool-no
		  more, no less. So my counsel went like this: "The Internet is just another 
		  way to share information. It's just another tool." <BR>
		  My message, then and now, is that the Internet can enable you to sell 
		  and deliver products to your customers via a ecommerce merchant account. 
		  If it's the appropriate tool, then use it! If it isn't the appropriate 
		  tool, then don't use it. <BR>
		  <BR>
		  2. E-commerce allows you to gather information from customers, while delivering 
		  a marketing-and-sales pitch through a Web site. <BR>
		  Although the information you gather concerns ecommerce merchant account 
		  orders, you can also ask customers or clients questions about who they 
		  are, where they want products shipped and billed to, what method of shipping 
		  they would like you to use-indeed, just about any question you would like 
		  to ask! In addition, ecommerce merchant account could enable you to process 
		  credit card information on the Internet, as well as take "cyber cash" 
		  from customers. <BR>
		  As an information dispensing-and-gathering device, e-commerce becomes 
		  a catch-all for using the Internet to conduct business per se. It allows 
		  you not only to advertise, market, and sell, but also to keep track of 
		  accounts receivables and payables, provide technology support...you get 
		  the idea, all from a single source: your Web site. <BR>
		  <BR>
		  3. E-commerce can be fully integrated ecommerce and shopping cart solutions 
		  or a technical "front-end" to a business that otherwise isn't wired. <BR>
		  Once you look at ecommerce and shopping cart solutions, you will need 
		  to consider the flow of information from your Web site into your back-office 
		  operations. Do you want a customer pushing a button to enter data into
		  your client database, send shipping instructions to a warehouse, charge 
		  a credit card, enter information into your accounting system, and, for 
		  that matter, deliver a cup of coffee to your desk as you sit reading your 
		  morning paper? It's up to you to decide how much or how little of the 
		  process you want to "go electronic." <BR>
		  Regardless of your approach-full integration, partial integration or no 
		  integration-you need to understand the process from start to finish before 
		  you proceed. If you don't understand the process up front, you run the 
		  risk of designing, redesigning, throwing out, starting over, and redesigning 
		  again, all of which is very, very expensive. The cost can range from $200 
		  a month for a simple ecommerce and shopping cart solutions setup to hundreds 
		  of thousands a month, all of which is comparable to the difference between 
		  using Quicken versus an enterprise-wide accounting package. <BR>
		  <BR>
		  4. The online world has as many ecommerce web site software solutions 
		  that suit a specific need as The Body Shop has bath products. If you don't 
		  feel you have the data to sort through and choose the best solution, you're 
		  hardly alone! <BR>
		  You can lick this problem easily. Work with a knowledgeable person you 
		  trust to help you understand not just the technical issues of the ecommerce 
		  web site software solution you're considering, but also the business issues. 
		  Examples of such professionals include consultants for the Internet, systems 
		  integrators, and technology-savvy marketing types. <BR>
		  <BR>
		  5. E-commerce is not about technology-it's about your business. While 
		  it is tempting to think of your ecommerce web site software solution as 
		  something "the geeks need to worry about," don't go there. <BR>
		  E-commerce is a part of how you run your business. It will be expensive 
		  to implement and should be seen as an investment. You should exercise 
		  the same care that you would use in choosing a 401K provider, suitable 
		  office space, your key personnel, or your enterprise-wide accounting package. 
		  <BR>
		  The e-commerce decision is one that you, the entrepreneur, have a choice 
		  in making. Do you want to conduct your day-to-day business online? If 
		  the answer is yes, then you need to work with sales, marketing, finance, 
		  tech support, customer service, information systems, network administration, 
		  support staff, and the receptionist to make sure you incorporate all pieces 
		  of an ecommerce web site software solution and inform all people about 
		  the purpose of the solution.</p>
