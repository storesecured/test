<B>Allow Customers To Ship Different Items To Different Locations</b>
<BR>At checkout customers can split their single cart and have it shipped to many different locations 
if you allow it.  This allows a single payment for different shipments.
<BR><BR>

<B>Items Coming From Different Locations</b>
<BR>The store allows for the configuration of different items coming from different locations and 
the ability to define different shipping rules for each different location.  This means if you have 
several different dropshippers and or warehouses you can configure the shipping for each differently 
to more accurately reflect your costs.
<BR><BR>

<B>UPS, Fedex, USPS, Canada Post Rates</b>
<BR>Automatically retrieve actual rates from UPS, Fedex, USPS and Canada Post in realtime 
for display on your website.  The shopping cart uses the starting zip code, ending zip code, 
and the weight of the products purchased to contact shippers you have enabled and find out the 
actual cost to ship via their services.  These costs are then displayed to your shoppers who can 
choose from the rates you have enabled and the cost is automatically added to their cart.
<BR><BR>

<B>Support Downloadable Goods</b>
<BR>For merchants who sell downloadable goods the products can be automatically delivered right to your
customers computers.  You can also waive shipping for these types of products.
<BR><BR>

<B>Set Maximum Box Weight</b>
<BR>Define a maximum weight per box for realtime shipping.  If total weight of the order exceeds the maximum box weight the
