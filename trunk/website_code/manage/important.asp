                   <span style="font-weight: bold;">Important Announcement</span><br><br>Effective Dec 1st at 11:45pm PST StoreSecured will be implementing an update to all stores.  This update will effect the URL string used to access items and departments in your store.  This change is coming as a result of increased importance by the major search engines in having keywords and item names in your URL string.  <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">For example</span><br>A example old dept url<br>================================ <br>http://www.yourdomainname.com/browse_dept_items.asp/categ_id/10<br><br>A example new dept url<br>================================ <br>http://www.yourdomainname.com/items/video-games/list.htm<br><br>A example old item url<br>================================
                   <BR>http://www.yourdomainname.com/browse_item_details.asp/Item_id/100/categ_id/10<br><br>A example new item url <br>================================ <br>http://www.yourdomainname.com/items/video-games/sony-playstation-3-detail.htm<br><br>The system will be automatically updating all auto-generated URLs to the new format on friday night.  However any manually generated urls will not automatically switch.  The system WILL continue to be able to handle the old URLs so that any existing links WILL continue to work.  We still recommend however that you eventually change any manually created links to the new format to help your search engine rankings.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">What does this mean to me?</span><br>A new field, named filename is now located on the item edit screens.  We highly recommend that you configure these fields for your items BEFORE end of day Friday Dec 1st.  You are not required to make any changes , if you do nothing, the system will auto-assign page names for each item and the upgrade will continue with those names.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">What should I use as my filename?</span><br>The filename field can contain only the letters a through z, numbers 0-9 and the dash (-) and underscore (_).  It should contain the name of your item and/or keywords a customer would use to access the item.  The field should be unique among all items in your store.  By default the store will set your filename to be your item name and sku with all special characters removed.  Google has recommended the use of the dash to separate words.  It is important to include the item name and/or keywords etc but do not overdo it, a name like sony-playstation-3-detail.htm is descriptive and will be well indexed by search engines.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why should I set it now?</span><br>Effective on friday night the store will start directing visitors to your new URL.  To minimize disruption, we do not recommend changing your filenames once they are set on friday.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why are you making this change?</span><br>At a recent search engine conference, each of the major search engines stressed the importance of using keywords and item names in your URLs for maximum effectiveness and top rankings and the increased rankings you will achieve by doing so.  As a result we felt it necessary to implement such a change for our merchants as soon as possible and embarked immediately to make this change.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">What about rankings I already have in search engines?</span><br>The store will automatically direct users and search engines who have saved your old urls to the new url version so that the change is seamless.  Likewise users who have items bookmarked in their browsers will be automatically sent to the new version as well.  <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">What else do I need to do?</span><br>We recommend reapplying your store template after the changes are implemented on friday night to fully realize the benefits.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">What happens if I dont do anything?</span><br>The store has already automatically assigned your items filenames based on the item name and sku.  For instance<br>Item Name=Sony Playstation 3<br>Item Sku=SONY-PS3<br>Department=Video Games<br>Auto generated url=<br>http://www.yourdomainname.com/video-games/sony-playstation-3-sony-ps3-detail.htm<br>The store will begin using these auto-generated URLS on friday night.<BR><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>Can I just use the names you generate?</span><br>Yes, you can however at times you might not like the name generated automatically and will want to
                   use your own name, we recommend at least reviewing the system generated names to ensure that you are happy with them.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Will anything else change?</span><br>No, we are adding additional search engine friendly information in the backend code, however no additional changes will be visible by users.
                   <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">How will this affect my store today?</span><br>This will not affect your store at all until the updates are input on friday night.  You are being notified of this today so that you have time to update the page names BEFORE the change takes place

                   <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Will there be any downtime for this update?</span><br>We do anticipate approximately 1 hour of scheduled downtime will be necessary in order to propogate these changes throughout all stores.  All websites will be placed into maintenance mode during the updates to minimize disruption.  This scheduled downtime will occur at approximately 11:45pm PST on Dec 1st.<br>
