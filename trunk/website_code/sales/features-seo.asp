<B>Seo Tips And Tools</b>
<BR>Free tips, video tutorials and articles all throughout the store builder to help you make the most out of your website.
<BR><BR>

<B>Search Engine Friendly Dynamic Pages</b>
<BR>Our store builder is optimized to make sure search engines can read and index all of the pages of your site 
even though they are dynamically generated.  This is not the case with many dynamic site builders.  Our filtering 
technology makes each page look static to the search engines which means better listings for you.
<BR><BR>

<B>Define Meta Keyword, Title and Description</b>
<BR>Define individual search engines tags at whatever level of detail you want.  Define tags for the entire store, 
for an individual page, for an item or even for a department.  Adding in different tags for each individual page 
increases the liklihood of getting listed under different search terms.
<BR><BR>

<B>Custom Page Head Sections</b>
<BR>For advanced users who want additional meta tags the store provides for custom header sections on each individual page 
which can be used to further optimize your individual pages for search engines.
<BR><BR>

<B>Automatic Catalog Generation With Keywords</b>
<BR>Based on the information you enter for your items and departments the store builder will automatically 
make pages for each item, each department, subdepartment and so on with your keywords, and descriptions
automatically entered.  No more manual updates to individual pages.  Updating your item in 1 location updates 
it everywhere your customer would see that item.
<BR><BR>

<B>Product Names In Title Tags</b>
<BR>Automatic insertion of your products name in the title tag, even if you do nothing, ensures that search engines 
can more easily find and index your products.
<BR><BR>

<B>Automatic Breadcrumb Navigation</b>
<BR>As your customers progress into your department/sub department heirarchy they might want to go back to where they came from.  
If they cannot find a way to easily get back they may become lost.  With Easystorecreator the customer is automatically given a 
listing at the top of the page showing the path they used to get to the current page with links to previous pages.  This increases 
the usability of the website.
