<H1>Third Party Merchant Accounts Described</h1>
<B>What is a 3rd party merchant account?</b><BR>
A 3rd party merchant account can provide anyone with a means to pay others via credit cards.  These
accounts are not real merchant accounts but they act similarly.
<BR><BR>
<B>How do 3rd party payment services work?</b><BR>
In this payment method the internet purchases are charged as if the 3rd party
payment service is the seller. Though the actual merchant sets up his store
with products and pricing, it is the 3rd party processor that is technically
the seller. The actual merchant then becomes a supplier and drop shipper.
<BR><BR>
<B>The differences</b><BR>
The main difference between 3rd party merchant accounts and a regular <a href=merchant-accounts.asp>merchant
account</a> are that the merchants funds are processed through a large bank account
and then dispersed to the individual merchants.
This method of clearing and settling transactions skirts
the rules established by Visa and MasterCard as well as
state and federal bank regulations. Because of these practices
3rd party providers face potential challenges from state banking
regulators. During the past two years, some states
have questioned whether 3rd party providers are operating an unauthorized
bank.<BR>
The second difference is that 3rd party merchant accounts require the shopper be
sent away from the shopping cart for a short while during which the ordering
will take place.  Usually the 3rd party processor will put their logo and branding
on the payment page which takes away from the overall flow and professionalism
of the shopping cart.<BR>
The third difference is that 3rd party merchant accounts generally distribute funds
only once a week or once a month versus merchant accounts in which this is done nightly.
<BR><BR>
<B>What are the benefits of 3rd Party merchant accounts?</b><BR>
Generally third party merchant accounts are easier to get started with.  The processor
requires less personal information and generally have less strict acceptance criteria.
In addition the startup fees are generally less and there is usually no monthly fee.
The absence of a monthly fee makes these accounts attractive to smaller businesses which
are unsure of monthly volumes.
<BR><BR>
<B>What are the drawbacks of 3rd party merchant accounts?</b><BR>
Generally third party merchant accounts have higher transaction and discount fees.  You
should expect to pay about 5% of each sale for a 3rd party account versus as little as
2.19% for a regular merchant account.   Buyers are less sometimes less confident in paying
a 3rd party company that they know little or nothing about and they wonder why the store
can't do their own credit card acceptance.
<BR><BR>
<B>Is this right for my business?</b><BR>
If your business is located outside of the US, you sell risky items or you have had trouble
getting approved for other merchant accounts this may be your only option to accepting
credit cards.  In this case go for it.  If your business is brand new and your not quite sure
if you can afford to pay a monthly fee you might want to try out payquake which offers a real
merchant account and no monthly fee.
<BR><BR>
<B>Final thoughts</b><BR>
Third party payment processors are a good alternative if all other options fail but they should
not be your first choice simply because you may lose sales and consumer confidence and in the long
run you will lose business.
