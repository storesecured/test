		<h1>Answering your questions about Merchant Account Provider, Merchant Account
		  Processor and Small Business Merchant Account options</h1>
		<p class="bodytext"><b>What is a merchant account?</b><BR>
		  A merchant account is way for businesses to accept credit cards both online 
		  and offline. Merchant account processor companies provide credit card 
		  authorization and charges in real-time. The merchant accounts Easystorecreator 
		  works with provide a programming interface that allows for direct integration 
		  between our software and their processing services.
		  <BR>
		  <BR>
		  <B>Why accept credit cards</b><BR>
		  80% of the world buys products and services on credit. Over 87% of all
		  Internet customers use credit cards and businesses loose sales over 60%
		  of the time if they don't accept credit card payments! <BR>
		  <BR>
		  Credit cards are ecommerce and trying to do business without them is like 
		  swimming against the tide. You need 2 things to accept credit cards, first 
		  a small business merchant account and second a way to process these transactions. 
		  At brick and mortar stores the processing takes place when your card is
		  swiped through the card reader. At online stores the processing is done
		  when a shopper types in their credit card information and it is verified 
		  by a merchant account processor. Easystorecreators partnerships with many
		  different merchant account providers allow you
		  to both have a merchant account and process credit cards. We provide a
		  variety of merchant account provider companies so that your company can 
		  find the solution that is right for your business. <BR>
		  <BR>
		  <B>How does it work?</b><BR>
		  With most merchant accounts, during checkout the shopper will be asked 
		  which method of payment they prefer to use, if they select a form of credit 
		  card payment they will be redirected to a secure page within the store 
		  to enter their credit card information. After the shopper selects submit, 
		  the credit card information will be sent to the correct merchant account 
		  where it will be verified and either accepted or denied by the merchant 
		  account service provider. If the transaction is denied the shopper will 
		  be alerted immediately so that they may correct and continue or cancel 
		  the transaction. The advantage of this system is that the user has never 
		  left your store and yet their transaction has been either accepted or 
		  denied and the goods can be immediately sent. The disadvantage is that
		  a monthly fee must be paid to the merchant account service provider
		  for this service. <BR>
		  <BR>
		  Paypal works slightly different from other payment processors. During 
		  a paypal checkout the shopper will be asked which method of payment they 
		  prefer to use, if they select a form of credit card payment they will
		  be redirected to the paypal login and/or signup page. If the shopper already 
		  has an account they will login and complete the transaction. If the shopper
		  does not already have an account they will be asked to enter a variety 
		  of information about themselves before the transaction can be completed. 
		  Then the shopper will be redirected to your store. The advantage of this 
		  system is a lower startup cost. The disadvantage of this system is that 
		  a shopper must leave your site to complete the transaction and some shoppers 
		  will not be willing to register with Paypal just to pay your store. In 
		  addition Paypals discount rate is higher than most other merchant account 
		  provider companies (discount rate is percentage of each sale which is 
		  deducted to cover merchant account service provider processing fees.) 
		  <BR>
		  <BR>
		  <B>Types of merchant accounts</b><BR>
		  Merchant accounts come in 2 varieties, card present and card not present. 
		  By law ecommerce stores are required to use card not present transactions 
		  because the shopper is not standing in front of them with a credit card. 
		  By their nature, card not present transactions are more risky and therefore 
		  are charged a higher discount rate. For companies which already have a 
		  credit card processing terminal we recommend talking with your bank before 
		  entering card not present transactions.<BR>
		  <BR>
		  <B>Credit Card Fraud</b><BR>
		  Internet credit card fraud has always been a problem. All of our merchant account provider companies do their best
		  to catch fraud. We have a variety of mechanisms in place to check shipping
		  addresses against the credit card billing address and to check card verification
		  codes with visa and mastercard. We recommend you use these features to
		  their fullest in order to lessen your companies liability. The benefits 
		  of accepting credit cards far outweigh the negatives but you should be 
		  aware and vigilant to lessen the impact on your business. <BR>
