<H1>How does it work?</h1>
One of the most confusing credit card processing concepts for online 
merchants is the difference between the "payment gateway account" 
(the online card processor) and "internet merchant accounts". Though 
these are two seperate components of credit card processing, they are 
both necessary and work together to handle payments automatically.
<BR><BR>
Internet Merchant Accounts are seperate bank accounts for the merchant 
that are approved and capable of receiving credit card payments from 
credit card providers. Internet merchant accounts typically do not hold 
funds for an extended period of time such as your typical bank account 
but usually transfer payments to another bank account designated by the 
internet merchant on a daily basis.
<BR><BR>
The Payment Gateway Account is the online credit card processor or 
transaction handler which is capable of hooking into credit card
accounts belonging to the online shopper and the merchant's internet 
merchant account (above). The payment gateway handles the verification 
and transfer requests. The term account when used with "payment gateway" 
is not a funds holding account but rather a "service account" that 
typically has a log in where you can configure your payment gateway 
settings.
<BR><BR>
Commercially available shopping carts such as <a href=http://www.easystorecreator.com>Easystorecreator</a>
typically have configuration settings allowing a number of gateway 
choices. An internet merchant will usually want to select the 
shopping cart and web site hosting company and then order their 
merchant account based on the gateways that are available
in the shopping cart. The following information diagrams the typical
payment process from the time the order is placed in the shopping cart to 
the funds being deposited in the merchant's bank account.
<BR><BR>
<B>Typical steps to an ecommerce transaction</b><BR>
The cardholder, via an internet connection and browser wants to pay 
for goods and services from the merchant.
<BR><BR>
The merchant passes the amount to be paid along with the cardholder’s 
details to the payment gateway for transfer to the acquiring bank so 
that the transaction can be authorised.
<BR><BR>
The payment gateway transfers this data via the internet to the 
acquiring bank, with which the merchant has a relationship.
<BR><BR>
The payment gateway passes the data to the acquiring bank for 
authorisation.
<BR><BR>
The acquiring bank passes the data into the various credit card 
networks so that the data arrives at the credit card issuer.
<BR><BR>
The credit card issuer checks the cardholder’s account to see if 
sufficient funds are available. If sufficient funds are available 
then the funds required for this transaction are reserved.
<BR><BR>
The Issuer then sends the result of this check back to the acquiring bank.
<BR><BR>
The acquiring bank sends this result to the payment gateway.
<BR><BR>
The payment gateway sends this result to the shopping cart software 
installed at the merchant. 
<BR><BR>
The shopping cart gives this result to the merchant.
<BR><BR>
If the authorisation result is negative, the merchant informs the 
cardholder and the transaction ends. If the authorisation result is 
positive then the merchant informs the cardholder and the goods or 
services are dispatched.
<BR><BR>
Once the goods or services are dispatched to the cardholder, the funds 
are transferred from the cardholder’s account to the acquiring bank.
<BR><BR>
The acquiring bank deposits the funds in the Merchant’s account . The 
merchant pays the acquiring bank for providing this service an agreed 
upon merchant fee.
<BR><BR>
Merchant account fees can be especially confusing for those new to 
ecommerce.  Click here for a complete description of <a href=merchant-account-fees.asp>merchant account fees</a>.
