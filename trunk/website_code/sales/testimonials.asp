<h2>Customer Testimonials</h2>
Approaching the end of our first year in business, TechNote Time Watch Company needed a
shopping cart which offered more features than the cart we had been using.   What a pleasure 
to find <%=Name %>.  <%=Name %> streamlined our order processing -  from invoicing 
to packing slips to shipping notifications - giiving our business a very professional image.  
Our cart was up and running with full stock of inventory in less two weeks.  Because of 
<%=Name %> we now have more time to devote to other daily business tasks.   We highly 
recommend <%=Name %> to any business, small or large.

<%=Name %>s eCommerce Solution makes sense for our business for two reasons: Availability
and Ease of Use. There is always live help available when you need it- even after business hours 
and on weekends. The software is very intuitive and simple to use- even for someone with less than 
stellar computer skills. <%=Name %> made it easy to get our store up and running, and keep 
it running, fast.

We were able to be up in selling our products in a fraction of the time it would have taken us to develop our own online store.

The software is very easy to learn and I also constantly receive  new software updates that 
improve the ease of use.  The software help take control of my website 
and saved me thousands of dollars a year by doing so.

The primary reason we moved from our initial web site design and hosting solution was the 
inability to readily manage the product catalog.  This became key to our business.  The ability 
to export and import sections of the product catalog have allowed to put complete product series 
groups on to the site in hours instead of days.  The Import/Export capability, along with the 
mass/bulk edit, have allowed us to work quickly with product pricing and availability issues.  
Other areas that have been key with <%=Name %> include: freight and shipping functionality,
reporting, site statistics, Froogle integration, and FTP access.

The software is very easy to use without having a computer background, has
features and tools that are not commonly available to small stores, and the
customer service can't be beat...fast and efficient replys to any questions
or concerns.

<%=Name %> was a great tool to help us develop our first ecommerce website. There are 
so many options to customize our product content, pricing structure and vast selection of 
products. The site is easy to use and gives our customers a valuable resource, all for a 
fraction of the price charged by other web developers.

<%=Name %> allowed me to start my own website quickly and provided me with the tools 
to learn how to make the site my own.  It also allowed me to choose incorporate shipping 
options and sign up for a merchant account easily.  Its a great way to create and manage your 
own online store!  No ebay for me!

Before coming to <%=Name %>, I spent $8,000.00 at another webhost and three seminars.
After working probably close to a 100 hours and reading more than 300 pages of how-to leaflets, 
pdf's, and booklets they have available, I was no closer than when I started to get my site listed a
and be a profitable eCommerce store. After signing up for the Gold Package at <%=Name %>, it
was only a month or so before I could navigate there program enough to make my own template and then 
I had <%=Name %> install it for me on their system for $40.00. The other place would have 
charged me over $500.00 to do the same thing. I am now grossing anywhere from $2,000.00 to $4,000.00 
weekly and with all my other expenses to get placed on the first page of search engines, I am now 
making a profit. There is no way I could have done this with the other company I use to be with.

<%=Name %> was the best choice for me due to its range of facilities including the 
best search engine friendly set ups for each page.

<%=Name %> offers so many features that enhance the operation of a website.  The low 
monthly cost is amazing. We paid for a year and received even a better rate!    My website
sales have more than doubled since I switched to <%=Name %>.  The easy integration of 
keywords resulted in a well known fashion publication contacting us and using one of our pieces.

<%=Name %> has everything we were looking for. We are able to add attributes that we 
were limited with on other site builders, giving us the flexibility we need. Very easy to use, 
easy to navigate, no down time that we have noticed and very reasonably priced. Brilliant Live Help 
- got me out of a fix on more than one occasion, and extremely helpful staff.

It was one of the easiest e-store builders I found, I tried several and stopped using them before 
30 day trial was up because they didn't have all the features I was looking for. With <%=Name %> 
I tried it and within 2 days I waas sold. Purchased the Silver program, submitted to search engines with 
help of <%=Name %> within a month I was on search engines and getting sales, ( most other web store 
builders had just 1 page you can do Meta tags, with <%=Name %> I can do each page which helped) moved 
up to higher store level and started adding more items and built up my web store. Well worth the money and 
was so impressed by sales and ease of website I did the year program.

<%=Name %> is the absolute EASIEST shopping site with the most advanced options.  It was 
very easy to learn and whenever I have a question, I use <%=Name %> on-line Help.  VERY 
reasonably priced as well.  I have tried out a LOT of other sites, and this is absolutely the best!!
