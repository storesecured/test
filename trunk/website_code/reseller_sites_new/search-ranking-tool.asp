		<h1>Search ranking tools and search optimization 
      software provide economical search engine optimization</h1>
		<p>One of the best ways to get traffic to your web site is 
      to optimize your pages for the search engines.  The hardest part 
      about optimizing your pages is knowing the right keywords to 
      optimize the pages for.   You might be able to get a number one 
      ranking but that wont help if no one ever searches on that term.  
      Conversely, you might try to optimize for a word that has millions 
      of other websites competing and your site might not show up until 
      page 100.  The best keywords to pick are those that are relevant
      to your site, have very little competition and a high number of 
      searches performed.  So, how do you know which keywords fit this profile?
      By using a <A href="http://our.affiliatetracking.net/wordtracker/a/8974"
      onMouseOver="status='http://www.wordtracker.com'; return true" 
      onMouseOut="status=''; return true">search ranking tool</a> such as 
      Word Tracker.  This tool is one of the best available and can be 
      invaluable in targeting keywords for your website.</p>
      <P>Now that you have your keywords selected you should choose 3 
      relevant keywords per page.  Ensure that these 3 keywords are use 
      throughout your webpage including the most important locations, the 
      title page, description, keywords and links.  Make sure that each 
      optimized page contains relevant content that will peak your visitors
      interest.  Adding too many keywords is considered spamming and may get
      your website banned from search engines.</p>

      <P>Once your pages are optimized the work is not done.  You need 
      to constantly monitor your search engine optimization.  There are 
      several tools available to keep reports from week to week and
      automatically monitor your sites movement.  We recommend <a href="http://www.softwarekey.com/products/info.asp?A=24571"

      get good rankings keep monitoring them to ensure they stay there.  If
