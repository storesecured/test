		<h1>Choosing a Merchant Credit Card Processing Vendor To Meet Your eCommerce
		  Credit Card Processing Needs</h1>
		<p>To process online orders, you must offer online payment options.
		  The most widely used form of payment currently is merchant credit card 
		  processing. Marketing studies show that you'll lose 60 percent to 80 percent 
		  of your potential orders if your Web site is not set up to accept credit 
		  cards; they also show that if you offer credit card payment and use merchant 
		  credit card processing, not only will you receive more orders, but those 
		  orders will be substantially larger. <BR>
		  <BR>
		  Credit cards enable impulse buying, reassure customers of your legitimacy, 
		  and simplify your billing. Other methods of collecting payment are becoming
		  available and include charging purchases to a phone bill, using electronic 
		  funds transfers (EFT), paying by electronic check and various forms of 
		  prepayment. Each of these methods requires payment processing either in 
		  the form of software added to your Web site or by linking to a payment 
		  processing service. <BR>
		  <BR>
		  <b>Understand Merchant Credit Card Processing Accounts and Their Fees</b><BR>
		  To accept credit cards, you must establish a merchant account, a special 
		  bank account for handling the revenue (and fees) from credit card transactions. 
		  Your merchant account provider (MAP)-a bank or other institution that 
		  processes online credit card transactions-will verify the credit card, 
		  process the transaction, and deposit the results into your account, usually 
		  within two to four days. <BR>
		  <BR>
		  <b>Evaluate Alternative Online Payment Methods</b><BR>
		  eCommerce credit card processing still reigns as the leading method of 
		  payment for online purchases, but other payment options are available. 
		  Your product and your customers' buying preferences will influence which 
		  payment methods you accept. In other countries, ecommerce credit card 
		  processing is not as pervasive, so you may want to consider offering alternatives 
		  for your international customers. Offering multiple payment options on 
		  your Web site, if you can afford it and maintain your profit margin, is 
		  a means to increase sales by increasing customer convenience and confidence. 
		  Many alternative methods are better suited to micro-payments, charges 
		  under $1, because the processing costs are often lower and credit card 
		  merchant-account fees don't apply. <BR>
		  <BR>
		  <b>Determine The Fee Structure That Maximizes Your Profit Margin</b><BR>
		  Not every product sells the same way, and not every ecommerce credit card 
		  processing provider charges you the same way. Choose a provider that suits 
		  your business. Begin by considering the nature of the products you sell-are 
		  they large and expensive? Perhaps then you ought to seek a MAP that offers 
		  a higher flat-rate transaction fee and minimizes the discount rate, since 
		  even a hefty $1 transaction fee will be far lower than a 2.5 percent deduction 
		  from the charge. On the other hand, if you rely on small, high-volume
		  sales, even a $0.30 transaction fee can erase your profits. <BR>
		  <BR>
		  <b>Specify Your Technical Requirements</b><BR>
		  Different MAPs require different "gateways" on your site. These gateways 
		  are the pieces of code that transmit your customers' orders to and from 
		  your bank's transaction authorizing agent. If you plan to manually process 
		  your orders, a secure Web form might be good enough to capture credit 
		  card information that you can process offline. <BR>
		  <BR>
		  <b>Evaluate Your Business's Credit-Worthiness</b><BR>
		  MAPs, like most banks, pay close attention to the companies with which 
		  they do business. Such factors as your company's length of time in business, 
		  outstanding debt, debt payment history, goods and services offered and 
		  even your personal history (for new businesses) will affect the fees your 
		  company pays to process credit card transactions on the Net. <BR>
		  <BR>
		  <b>Find MAPs You Can Work With</b><BR>
		  Many merchant account credit card processing providers refuse accounts 
		  to start-up firms or firms and individuals with bad credit histories. 
		  Some MAPs will not accept "high-risk" accounts, a term that usually encompasses 
		  adult sites, online casinos, and sites operated by firms outside the MAP's 
		  own nation. Other merchant account credit card processing providers refuse 
		  to process any transactions that originate on the Internet-even from their 
		  own existing brick-and-mortar clients-or may require that you create a 
		  separate merchant account to process orders that are not taken face-to-face 
		  but are received by mail, phone, or via the Internet. <BR>
		  <BR>
		  <b>Compare Fees and Technical Capabilities</b><BR>
		  Once you've developed a list of merchant account credit card processing 
		  providers who might offer you an account, you need to compare the different 
		  MAP offerings. Be certain to ask detailed questions about each MAP's technical 
		  requirements, and make sure your system can work with your MAP's gateways-the 
		  software that actually submits your customers' credit card information 
		  for payment authorization. <BR>
		  <BR>
		  <b>Minimize Credit Card Chargebacks</b><BR>
		  Discussion about consumer credit card protection for Internet purchases 
		  has become intense. But the fact is that U.S. federal law limits a consumer's 
		  liability for unauthorized charges to $50, whether the purchase was made 
		  face-to-face or on the Internet. No such protective legislation exists 
		  for merchants, however, and they bear the full cost of fraudulent charges 
		  as chargebacks from their banks. When a fraudulent credit card transaction 
		  takes place without the physical card being presented to the merchant, 
		  or funds are uncollectible for some other reason, merchants are charged 
		  the sale amount by the cardholder's bank. This is known in the industry
		  as a chargeback. Merchants may also be asked to pay penalty fees in addition 
		  to the cost of the original charge. Though it has not been as hot a topic 
		  for e-tailers, credit card chargebacks pose a serious threat to profits. 
		  To reduce revenue losses due to credit card fraud, online businesses need 
		  to take steps to reduce the risk they take with every order received through 
		  their Web sites. Find out how credit card chargebacks occur and what you 
		  can do to protect yourself. <BR>
		  <BR>
		  <b>Secure All Your Transaction Data and Prevent Fraud</b><BR>
		  Credit card information is extremely sensitive, and plenty of villains 
		  are waiting to exploit any breach in your security. Additionally, online 
		  merchants are as susceptible to credit-card fraud as face-to-face retailers. 
		  Make sure your merchant account provider has addressed these issues. <BR>
		  <BR>
		  <b>Prepare for International Payment Processing</b><BR>
		  Some payment processing and merchant account providers do not accommodate
		  international commerce. If you plan to market your product globally, you 
		  may need to search specifically for an international provider.</p>
