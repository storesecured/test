<H1>Forms of electronic payment</h1>
<B>Visa and Mastercard</b><BR>
By default all merchant accounts are able to accept both 
Visa and Mastercard.  The discount rates and transaction 
fees displayed are valid for accepting both of these cards.

<B>American Express</b><BR>
American Express acceptance can be added to nearly all merchant
accounts.  You can establish an American Express account directly
with American Express or when setting up a new merchant account.  
American Express has a special flat rate for merchants
who process less than $4000 annually.  Once you pass $4000 annually
the discount rate is approximately 3.5% per transaction for internet 
and home based businesses.

<B>Discover</b><BR>
Discover acceptance can also be added to nearly all merchant
accounts.  You can establish a Discover account directly with 
Discover.  Discover charges between 2% and 3% discount rate plus a 
small transactionf fee, these fees vary
depending on your business type and average transaction amount.
<BR><BR>
<B>Electronic Checks</b><BR>
eChecks are quickly becoming a popular method of payment.  
eCheck payments can only be sent by customers with US bank accounts 
but usually only cost the merchant a flat transaction fee instead 
of a discount rate and transaction fee.  Some merchant accounts 
include eCheck support and some do not.  There is usually an 
additional monthly fee for eChecks.
