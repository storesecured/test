Old Stuff Vintage Antiques & Collectibles was founded in January of 1990 as a regular brick and mortar business.  
The business was started when many years ago, a bulldozer operator uncovered a cavern locally on the old Christian 
Mohrlein beer site that contained several hundred unused turn of the century crock Christian Mohrlein beer bottles.  
My father bought them all for $1 each and sold them to the local antique dealers for $3 each.  They sold very quickly 
and everyone involved was very happy as most of the dealers turned a quick profit on them too.  That was the beginning.  
We are truly modern day treasure hunters.  We have been looking for large quantity genuinely old items to sell to 
antique dealers ever since.

Unfortunately the brick and mortar business was lost to a fire a year and half ago and the family could not afford the 
startup costs for a business that took 15 years to build.  They were able to restart very inexpensively using the
StoreSecured software.  "We are already profitable, " says Don "but expect to boost sales very substantially in the coming year by doing 
mailings to our existing customers about the site.  It has been very exciting to see this happening so quickly.
StoreSecured is truly an amazing system.  It is extremely easy to use.  The support service is 
very quick to respond and help.  
There have been no issues they could not resolve in short order.  The premade templates are very easy to adapt.  
Our antique business is not the typical business these type of templates are made for, but they had everything I needed 
to make it look like an antique site in short order.  One other thing that I think is amazing is that I looked at a lot 
of different store setups before I went to this one, and this was not only the best one I found feature for feature, but 
one of the less expensive ones and also Windows and Mac friendly."</td></tr></table>

Old Stuff Vintage Antiques & Collectibles strategy is unique.  Don has searched the country for many years looking for items that are 
40 years of age or  older that are still around in some quantity.  For example, he visited many toy distributors.  They buy an item 
when it is popular, and sometimes throw the leftovers in the warehouse when the fad dies out.  They sometimes have 
hundreds of a particular item from years ago.  He tries to tell his customers a little bit about where each item was found
in the description.  Because they buy in bulk, they are able to buy at prices that allow selling to antique dealers 
who resell the items.  It is a different niche in what is normally a competitive business.  The family has been doing 
it for over 20 years.

Getting people to shop at your store is always a challenge.  To overcome this "we are using the google feed which is 
absolutely free and built right into this site has brought a lot of traffic."  says Don "Most of the rest comes in from Google Adwords 
and other search engines."
