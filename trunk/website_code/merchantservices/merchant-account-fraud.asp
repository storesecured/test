<H1>Preventing Credit Card Fraud</h1>
There has been a tremendous increase in the number of merchants 
who have been scammed by crooks who place fraudulent orders using 
stolen credit card information. Unfortunately, merchants are not 
provided the same protection as consumers when it comes to credit 
card fraud. In fact, merchants are completely at risk.
<BR><BR>
Online credit payments are classed as Mail Order and Telephone Order
sales by credit card companies, yet suffer far higher chargeback rates. 
While the Visa and MasterCard quote overall card fraud at around 0.08 
per cent of all transactions, online fraud (for which no separate 
figures are released) is estimated by online traders at somewhere 
between three and five percent. The figures are higher than for mail 
order or telephone sales. The fact that neither Visa nor MasterCard 
will provide such figures should give all online retailers pause for 
thought.
<BR><BR>
Physical presence offers security based on a customer signature and 
card imprint. But the merchant is almost always responsible for losses 
when sales are made on a 'Cardholder Not Present' basis even when the 
vendor has obtained authorisation from the card issuer.
<BR><BR>
Begin taking a few extra steps to validate each order. Don't accept 
orders unless complete information is provided (including full 
address and phone number). We also now require Address Verification 
for all of our credit card orders.  Most credit card gateways will 
show the level of match between billing information provided and 
credit card billing information on file.  Use this level of match to
determine whether the transaction appears legitimate.
<BR><BR>
Be wary of orders with different "bill to" and "ship to" addresses. 
Some companies now require anyone who uses a different "ship to" 
address to send a fax with their signature and credit card number
authorizing the transaction.
<BR><BR>
Be especially careful with orders that come from free email services 
-- there is a much higher incidence of fraud from these services 
(hotmail.com, juno.com, usa.net, etc.). Many businesses won't even 
accept orders that come through these free email accounts anymore. 
That's because it's so easy for a scamster to open a free, anonymous 
email account in another person's name and then send you, the merchant,
an order using the fake email account and a fraudulent credit card 
number.
<BR><BR>
Be especially wary of orders that are larger than your typical order 
amount, and orders with next day delivery. Crooks don't care what it 
costs, since they aren't planning on paying for it anyway.
<BR><BR>
Pay extra attention to international orders. Do everything you can 
to validate the order before you ship your product to a different country.
<BR><BR>
If you're suspicious, pick up the phone and call the customer to 
confirm the order. Believe us, it will save you a lot of time, and 
money, in the long run.
<BR><BR>
If your processor offers additional fraud detection tools use them to
their fullest extent.
